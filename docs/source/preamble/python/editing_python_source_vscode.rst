.. _Editing Python source:

Editing Python source (with :program:`VS Code`)
===============================================

.. note:
   The program you use to edit sources is an aesthetic/convenience choice. It does not affect how ROS2 works.

There are near-infinite ways to manage your Python code and, in this section, we will use :program:`VS Code`. 

Installing :program:`VS Code`
----------------------------

It is important to have a predicable environment for the tutorial, therefore we will download a particular version of :program:`VS Code`.
  
Run

.. code :: console

   cd ~
   mkdir ros2_workspace_vscode
   cd ros2_workspace_vscode
   wget -O code_1.93.0-stable_amd64.deb https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.93.0/linux-deb-x64/stable
   sudo dpkg -i code_1.93.0-stable_amd64.deb
   

Running :program:`VS Code`
--------------------------

It will be installed as a regular Ubuntu application, so you can find it by searching for "Visual Studio Code". It is also beneficial to right-click the icon in search and choose "Add to Favourites".

Adding the ROS plugin to :program:`VS Code`
-------------------------------------------

Open the extensions tab with :kbd:`CTRL+SHIFT+X`.It will open a tab like so.

Search for "ROS" and click "Install". Please be careful to choose the Microsoft plugin. There are many other plugins with the same name, but made by others.
