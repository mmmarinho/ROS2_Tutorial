Creating a Python Library (for :program:`ament_python`)
=======================================================

Let us start, as already recommended in this tutorial, with a template by :program:`ros2 pkg create`.

.. code :: console

   cd ~/ros2_tutorial_workspace/src
   ros2 pkg create python_package_with_a_library \
   --build-type ament_python \
   --library-name sample_python_library
   
which outputs the forever beautiful wall of text we're now used to, with a minor difference regarding the additional library template, as highlighted below.

.. code-block:: console
   :emphasize-lines: 25, 26

The folders/files, Mason, what do they mean?
--------------------------------------------

The ROS2 package created from the template has a structure like so. In particular, we can see that :file:`python_package_with_a_library` is repeated twice in a row. This is a common source of error, so don't forget!

.. code-block:: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,2
   
   python_package_with_a_library
      └── python_package_with_a_library
         └── sample_python_library
            __init__.py
         __init__.py
      └── resource
         python_package_with_a_library
      └── test
      package.xml
      setup.cfg
      setup.py
      
We learned the meaning of most of those in the preamble, namely :ref:`Python Best Practices`. To quickly clarify a few things, see the table below.

.. list-table:: ROS2 Python package folders/files explained
   :header-rows: 1

   * - File/Directory
     - Meaning
   * - :file:`python_package_with_a_library`
     - The ROS2 package folder.
   * - :file:`python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library`
     - The Python package, as we saw in the preamble.
   * - :file:`sample_python_library`
     - The module corresponding to our sample library.
   * - :file:`resource/python_package_with_a_library`
     - A file for ROS2 to index this package correctly. See `Resource file <https://answers.ros.org/question/367328/ament_python-package-doesnt-explicitly-install-a-marker-in-the-package-index/>`_.
   * - :file:`test`
     - The folder contaning the tests, as we already saw in the preamble.
   * - :file:`setup.cfg`
     - Used by setup.py, see `setup.cfg docs <https://docs.python.org/3.10/distutils/configfile.html>`_.
   * - :file:`setup.py`
     - The instructions to make the package installable, as we saw in the preamble.

Overview of the library
-----------------------

.. hint::
   If you have created the bad habit of declaring all/too many things in your :file:`__init__.py` file, take the hint and start breaking the definitions into different files and use the :file:`__init__.py` just to export the relevant parts of your library. 

For the sake of the example, let us create a library with a Python :code:`function` and another one with a :code:`class`. To guide our next steps, we first draw a quick overview of what our :code:`python_package_with_a_library` will look like.

.. code-block:: console
   :emphasize-lines: 4,5,6
   
   python_package_with_a_library
      └── python_package_with_a_library
         └── sample_python_library
            __init__.py
            _sample_class.py
            _sample_function.py
         __init__.py
      └── resource
      └── test
      
With respect to the highlighted files, we will

#. Create the :code:`_sample_function.py`.
#. Create the :code:`_sample_class.py`.
#. Modify :file:`__init__.py` to use the new function and class.      
      
All other files and directories will remain as-is, in the way they were generated by :program:`ros2 pkg create`.      
      
Create the sample function
--------------------------

Create a new file with the following contents and name.

:download:`~/ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library/sample_python_library/_sample_function.py <../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library/sample_python_library/_sample_function.py>`

.. literalinclude:: ../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library/sample_python_library/_sample_function.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 26-

The function has two parameters, :code:`a` and :code:`b`. For simplicity, we're expecting arguments of type :code:`float` and returning a :code:`float`, but it could be any Python function.

Create the sample class
-----------------------

Create a new file with the following contents and name. 

:download:`~/ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library/sample_python_library/_sample_class.py <../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library/sample_python_library/_sample_class.py>`

.. literalinclude:: ../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library/sample_python_library/_sample_class.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 26-
   
The class is quite simple with a `private data member <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables>`_ and a method to retrieve it.
   
Modify the :code:`__init__.py` to export the symbols
----------------------------------------------------

With the necessary files created and properly organized, the last step is to :code:`import` the function and the class. We modify proper :file:`__init__.py` file with the following contents.

:download:`~/ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library/sample_python_library/__init__.py <../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library/sample_python_library/__init__.py>`

.. literalinclude:: ../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library/sample_python_library/__init__.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 24-

Modify the :code:`setup.py` to export the packages
--------------------------------------------------

.. warning::
   This step might be unnecessary after `this fix <https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/833>`_.

.. note::

   This is a *one-size-fits-most* solution, which might not work for certain Python package structures. As a generic solution, we will export all Python packages in the ROS2 package excluding the `test` directory. For more information on :program:`setuptools`, see the `official Python packaging docs <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/>`_.

:download:`~/ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/setup.py <../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/setup.py>`

.. literalinclude:: ../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/setup.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 1,8

Build and source
----------------

No surprise here, right?

.. include:: the_canonical_build_command.rst

If it builds without any unexpected issues, we're good to go!
