.. _Asyncio:

Python's :code:`asyncio`
========================

.. note::
   Asynchronous code is not the same as code that runs in parallel, even more so in Python because of the :abbr:`GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)` (`More info <https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock>`_).
   Basically, the :code:`async` framework allows us to not waste time waiting for results that we don't know when will arrive.
   It either allows us to attach a :code:`callback` for when the result is ready, or to run many service calls and :code:`await`
   for them all, instead of running one at a time.

There are two main ways to interact with :code:`async` code, the first being by :code:`await`\ ing the results or by handling those
results through :code:`callbacks`. Let's go through both of them with examples.

Use a :code:`venv`
------------------

We already know that it is a good practice to :ref:`Isolate your environment with a venv`. So, let's turn that into a reflex
and do so for this whole section.

.. code-block:: console

   cd ~
   source ros2tutorial_venv/bin/activate

Create the :file:`minimalist_async` package
-------------------------------------------

.. admonition:: In this step, we'll work on these.

   .. code-block:: console
      :emphasize-lines: 2,3
      
      python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/
        └── minimalist_async/
              └── __init__.py

As we learned in :ref:`Python package`, let's make a package called :file:`minimalist_async`.

.. code-block:: console

   cd ~/ros2_tutorials_preamble/python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package
   mkdir minimalist_async
   cd minimalist_async

we then create an :file:`__init__.py` file with the following contents

:download:`__init__.py <../../../../preamble/python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/minimalist_async/__init__.py>`

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../preamble/python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/minimalist_async/__init__.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 1-

Create the :code:`async` function
---------------------------------

.. admonition:: In this step, we'll work on this.

   .. code-block:: console
      :emphasize-lines: 4
      
      python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/
        └── minimalist_async/
              └── __init__.py
              └── _unlikely_to_return.py


Let's create a module called :file:`_unlikely_to_return.py` to hold a function used for this example at the :file:`~/ros2_tutorials_preamble/python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/minimalist_async` folder with the following contents

:download:`_unlikely_to_return.py <../../../../preamble/python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/minimalist_async/_unlikely_to_return.py>`

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../preamble/python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/minimalist_async/_unlikely_to_return.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 24-
   :emphasize-lines: 6,11,15,24

Because we're using :code:`await` in the function, we start by defining an :code:`async` function.

.. hint::
   If the function/method uses :code:`await` anywhere, it should be :code:`async` (`More info <https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/>`_).

This function was thought this way to emulate, for example, us waiting for something
external without actually having to. To do so,  we add a :code:`while True:` and return only with 10% chance. Instead of using a :code:`time.sleep()` we
use :code:`await asyncio.sleep(0.1)` to unleash the power of :code:`async`. The main difference is that :code:`time.sleep()` is synchronous (blocking), meaning that the interpreter
will be locked here until it finishes. With :code:`await`, the interpreter is free to do other things and come back to this one later after the desired amount of time has elapsed.

The function by itself doesn't do much, so let's use it in another module.

Using :code:`await`
-------------------

.. admonition:: **TL;DR** Using :code:`await`
      
   #. Run multiple :code:`Task`\ s.
   #. Use :code:`await` for them, **after they were executed**.

.. admonition:: In this step, we'll work on this.

   .. code-block:: console
      :emphasize-lines: 5
      
      python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/
        └── minimalist_async/
              └── __init__.py
              └── _unlikely_to_return.py
              └── async_await_example.py

Differently from synchronous programming, using :code:`async` needs us to reflect on several tasks being executed at the same time(-ish).
The main use case is for programs with multiple tasks that can run concurrently and, at some point, we need the result of those tasks to either
end the program or further continue with other tasks.

The :code:`await` strategy we're seeing now is suitable when either we need the results from all tasks before proceeding or when the order of results matters.

To illustrate this, let's make a file called :file:`async_await_example.py` in :file:`minimalist_async` with the following contents.

:download:`async_await_example.py <../../../../preamble/python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/minimalist_async/async_await_example.py>`

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../preamble/python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/minimalist_async/async_await_example.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 24-

We start by importing the :code:`async` method we defined in the other module

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../preamble/python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/minimalist_async/async_await_example.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 25

The function will be run by an instance of :code:`asyncio.Task`. When the task is created, it is equivalent to calling the function and it starts running concurrently to the script that created the task. The example is a bit on the fancy side to make it easier to read and mantain, but the concept is simple. When using the :code:`await` paradigm, focus on the following

#. Make the function it should run, like our :code:`unlikely_to_return()`.
#. Run all concurrent tasks and keep a reference to them as :code:`asyncio.Task`.
#. :code:`await` on each :code:`asyncio.Task`, in the order in which you want those results.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../preamble/python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/minimalist_async/async_await_example.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 28-47
   :emphasize-lines: 3,8,18

Ok, enough with the explanation, let's go to the endorphin rush of actually running the program with

.. code-block:: console

   cd ~/ros2_tutorials_preamble/python/minimalist_package/
   python3 -m minimalist_package.minimalist_async.async_await_example

Which will result in something like shown below. The function is stochastic, so it might take more or less time to 
return and the order of the tasks ending might also be different.

However, in the :code:`await` framework, the results will **ALWAYS** be processed in the order that was specified
by the :code:`await`, **EVEN WHEN THE OTHER TASK ENDS FIRST**, as in the example below. This is neither good nor bad,
it will be proper for some cases and not proper for others.

We can also see that both tasks are running concurrently until :code:`task2` finishes, then only :code:`task1` is executed.

.. code-block:: console
   :emphasize-lines: 13,20,21,22

   Awaiting results...

   The result of task=task2 was 0.06380247590535493.
   
   Process finished with exit code 0

Hooray! May there be concurrency!

Using :code:`callback`
----------------------

.. admonition:: **TL;DR** Using :code:`callbacks`
      
   #. Run multiple :code:`Task`\ s.
   #. Add a :code:`callback` to handle the result **as soon as it is ready**.
   #. Use :code:`await` for each :code:`Task` just so that the main loop does not return prematurely.

.. admonition:: In this step, we'll work on this.

   .. code-block:: console
      :emphasize-lines: 5
      
      python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/
        └── minimalist_async/
              └── __init__.py
              └── async_await_example.py
              └── async_callback_example.py

Differently from :code:`await`\ ing for each task and then processing their result, we can define :code:`callbacks`
in such a way that each result will be processed as they come. In that way, the results can be processed in an arbitrary
order. Once again, this is inherently neither a good strategy nor a bad one. Some frameworks will work with callbacks,
for example ROS1, ROS2, and Qt, but some others will prefer to use :code:`await`.

Enough diplomacy, let's make a file called :file:`async_callback_example.py` in :file:`minimalist_async` with the following contents.

:download:`async_callback_example.py <../../../../preamble/python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/minimalist_async/async_callback_example.py>`

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../preamble/python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/minimalist_async/async_callback_example.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 24-

In the :code:`callback` paradigm, besides the function that does the actual task, as in the prior example, we have to make
a, to no one's surprise, callback function to process the results as they come.

We do so with 

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../preamble/python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/minimalist_async/async_callback_example.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 29-40

In this case, the :code:`callback` must receive a :code:`asyncio.Future` and process it. Test the future for :code:`None` in 
case the task fails for any reason.

Aside from that, there are only two key differences with the :code:`await` logic example we showed before,

#. The callback must be added with :code:`task.add_done_callback()`, remember to use :code:`partial()` if the callback has other parameters besides the :code:`Future`
#. :code:`await` for the tasks at the end, not because this script will process it (it will be processed as they come by its :code:`callback`), but because otherwise the main script will return and (most likely) nothing will be done.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../preamble/python/minimalist_package/minimalist_package/minimalist_async/async_callback_example.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 43-62
   :emphasize-lines: 10,20

`But enough talk… Have at you! <https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/die-monster-what-is-a-man>`_ Let's run the code with

.. code-block:: console

   cd ~/ros2_tutorials_preamble/python/
   python3 -m minimalist_package.minimalist_async.async_callback_example

Depending on our luck, we will have a very illustrative result like the one below. This example shows that, with the :code:`callback` logic, when the second task
ends before the first one, it will be automatically processed by its :code:`callback`.

.. code-block:: console
   :emphasize-lines: 5,6,11,12

   task1 retry needed (roll = 0.1996764883575476 > 0.1).

   task1 retry needed (roll = 0.20026037098687932 > 0.1).            
   task1 Done.
   The result of task=task1 was 0.09676678954317675.

Can you feel the new synaptic connections?
