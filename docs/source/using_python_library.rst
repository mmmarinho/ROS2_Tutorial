Using a Python Library from another package (for :program:`ament_python`)
======================================================================

Let us create a package with a Node that uses the library we created in the prior example. 

Note that we must add the :code:`python_package_with_a_library` as a dependency to our new package. The easiest way to do so is through :program:`ros2 pkg create`. We also add :code:`rclcpp` as a dependency so that our Node can do something useful.

.. code :: console

   cd ~/ros2_tutorial_workspace/src
   ros2 pkg create python_package_that_uses_the_library \
   --dependencies rclpy python_package_with_a_library \
   --build-type ament_python \
   --node-name node_that_uses_the_library
   
resulting in yet another version of our favorite wall of text

The sample Node
---------------

Given that it was created from a template, the file :file:`python_package_that_uses_the_library/python_package_that_uses_the_library/node_that_uses_the_library.py` is currently *mostly* empty. Let us replace its contents with 

:download:`node_that_uses_the_library.py <../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_that_uses_the_library/python_package_that_uses_the_library/node_that_uses_the_library.py>`

.. literalinclude:: ../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_that_uses_the_library/python_package_that_uses_the_library/node_that_uses_the_library.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 27-

Indeed, the most difficult part is to make and configure the library itself. After that, to use it in another package, it is straightforward. We :code:`import` the library.

.. literalinclude:: ../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_that_uses_the_library/python_package_that_uses_the_library/node_that_uses_the_library.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 27-29
   :emphasize-lines: 3
   
And then use the symbols we imported as we would with any other Python library.

.. literalinclude:: ../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_that_uses_the_library/python_package_that_uses_the_library/node_that_uses_the_library.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 40-55
   :emphasize-lines: 10, 14

Build and source
----------------

As always, this is needed so that our new package and node can be recognized by :program:`ros2 run`.

.. include:: the_canonical_build_command.rst

Run
---

.. hint::
   Remember that you can stop the node at any time with :kbd:`CTRL+C`.

.. code :: console

   ros2 run python_package_that_uses_the_library node_that_uses_the_library
   
Which outputs something similar to the shown below, but with different numbers and strings as they are randomized.

.. code :: console
