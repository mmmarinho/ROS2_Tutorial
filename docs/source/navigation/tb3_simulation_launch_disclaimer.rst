.. important::

    Differently from everything else used in this tutorial, this ``tb3_simulation_launch.py`` demo does not always finishes
    cleanly on my machines. It has hanged sometimes, sometimes :program:`Gazebo` does not show, and sometimes it does not shutdown properly.

    It is highly recommended to use a docker container, such as `<https://github.com/UoMMScRobotics/sfr_gazebo_nav2>`_,
    to minimise disappointment.
