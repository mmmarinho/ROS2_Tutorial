üìñ **About this tutorial** 

`ROS2 Humble <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/>`_ tutorials by `Murilo M. Marinho <https://murilomarinho.info/>`_, focusing on Ubuntu 22.04 x64 LTS and the programming practices of successful state-of-the-art robotics implementations such as the `SmartArmStack <https://github.com/SmartArmStack>`_ and the `AISciencePlatform <https://github.com/AISciencePlatform>`_.

ü§ü **Using this tutorial** 

This is a tutorial that supposes that the user will follow it linearly. Some readers can skip the :doc:`Preamble <preamble/ubuntu>` if they are somewhat already comfortable in Python and Ubuntu. Otherwise, all steps can be considered as dependent on the prior ones, starting from :doc:`ROS2 Setup <installation>`. 

üîç **Quick overview**

#. :doc:`Preamble: Ubuntu Basics <preamble/ubuntu>`
    A few tips on Ubuntu/terminal usage.

#. :doc:`Preamble: Python Basics <preamble/python>` 
    A quick memory refresher for the Python stuff we'll use in ROS2.

#. :doc:`ROS2 Setup <installation>` (‚≠êstart here‚≠ê)
    Installing ROS2 and setting up its environment for use.

#. :doc:`ROS2 Python Package/Build Basics <create_packages>`
    Creating our first ROS2 package with :program:`ament_python` and building it with :program:`colcon`.

#. :doc:`ROS2 Python Node Basics <running_node>`
    Creating a ``rclpy`` Node and figuring out what all that means.

#. :doc:`ROS2 Python Library Basics <create_python_library>`
    Create a Python library and importing/using it in another :program:`ament_python` package.

#. :doc:`ROS2 Python Interface Basics <messages>`
    Making ROS2 messages, services, publishers, subscribers, service servers, and service clients.

#. :doc:`ROS2 Parameter/Launch Basics <parameters_and_launch>`
    Making configurable ROS2 Nodes using parameters and launch files.
